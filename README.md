# kotlin-piano

I was on the bench and wanted to do Sonic Pi, but I also want OOP, so I can capture elements of the musical domain in
objects with methods, which enable me to talk and reason about my program. This is in order to do some real baller
shit, like generating music automatically based on a key signature, chord progressions, cadences, melodies and
hopefully all sorts of other input data. I don't really have time though so this has mostly been a learning exercise
for the Java sound API, Java concurrency primitives, and a bit of Kotlin.

When I explained it to Al Hall, he said this, which resonated with my goals: "So you're making a DSL to write songs?"
