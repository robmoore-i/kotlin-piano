# Sounds

I want to do Sonic Pi, but I also want OOP, so I can capture elements of the musical domain in objects with methods,
which enable me to talk and reason about my program. This is in order to do cool shit, like generating music
automatically based on a key signature, chord progressions, cadences, melodies and hopefully all sorts of other input
data.
